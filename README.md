# Node Webkit Devtools Agent Front-End

[![Greenkeeper badge](https://badges.greenkeeper.io/danmactough/node-webkit-agent-frontend.svg)](https://greenkeeper.io/)

Your WebKit devtools front-end for [Node WebKit Agent](//github.com/c4milo/node-webkit-agent).

Instead of connecting your Node debugging session to a gh-pages site, you can
easily self-host the front-end code for connecting to your WebKit devtools agent.

## Installation

`npm install -g webkit-devtools-agent-frontend`

In the application you want to profile, install and run [Node WebKit Agent](//github.com/c4milo/node-webkit-agent).

## Connecting to the agent

1. Activate the agent in your application by sending a `SIGUSR2` signal to its process id. To de-activate, send the signal once again. Example: `kill -SIGUSR2 <the process id of your app>`

2. Start the agent front-end by running `webkit-devtools-agent-frontend`. You should see the message: "WebKit devtools agent front-end listening on http://localhost:9090". Using your browser, go to that URL, and profile away.

## Configuration

You can change the port on which the agent front-end listens using the NODE_WEBKIT_DEVTOOLS_PORT environment variable, e.g., `NODE_WEBKIT_DEVTOOLS_PORT=9099 webkit-devtools-agent-frontend` to listen on port 9099.
